# Hybrid Motion Model For Multiple Object Tracking
This project proposes a real-time system for multiple object tracking using the Hybrid Motion Model (HMM). The proposed system combines two different types of motion models to accurately estimate the position and velocity of objects in a video sequence captured by a camera. The system includes stages such as data acquisition, pre-processing, object detection, and object tracking, and utilizes machine learning algorithms to detect and classify objects in the video sequence. The performance of the system is evaluated based on various metrics such as tracking accuracy, speed, and memory usage, and is compared with existing state-of-the-art systems to demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed HMM-based approach has the potential for various applications such as surveillance, robotics, and augmented reality.
